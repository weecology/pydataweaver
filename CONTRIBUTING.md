# Contributing to the Data Weaver

We welcome contributions of all kinds including improvements to the core code,
addition of new dataset scripts to add new datasets to the Weaver,
improvements to the documentation, bug reports, or anything else you can think
of. We strive to be supportive of anyone who wants to contribute, so don't be
shy, give it a go, and we'll do our best to help.  

The [Documentaion](https://weaver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) is a another good place to start.

## Process for contributing changes

We use a standard
[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for
development and reviewing contributions. Fork the repository. Make changes to a
branch of your fork and then submit a pull request.


## Continuous integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for continuous integration
testing. All pull requests will automatically report whether the tests are
passing.
